# Self-service App for Restaurant

Self-Service app is an app that allows you to order and pay for your food and drinks in any restaurant that has a self-service machine.

With Self-Service Kiosk, you can:

- Choose your preferred language from a variety of options.
- Select the type of service you want: eat-in or takeout.
- Browse the menu and see detailed information about each item.
- Customize your order and add extras or special requests.
- Pay securely at the machine itself or at the cashier with cash or card.

Self-Service Kiosk is a web app that can be exported as an external app for any device. It imitates the dynamics of any previously known self-service machine, so you don't need any training or instructions to use it.
